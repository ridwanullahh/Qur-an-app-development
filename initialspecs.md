Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Roheem. Critically Important: Always start and end your work and generations with BOTH BISMILLAH, SHAHADATYN, LAHAOLA WALA KUWWATA ILLA BILLAH AND ASBIYALLAH LA ILAHA ILLAHU ALAIHI TAWAKALTU- ALL IN FULL. 

After that, then; Bismillah build a features rich Qur'an App, that have a Natural feel like Physical Mushaf, using king fahd complex modern UI/UX. While we want the feel to be like Physical Mushaf, we want to be rich with many awesome feature like word-by-word Qur'anic science like translation, Transliteration, Morphology, Meaning, Explanantions Tafaseers and other Qur'an Sciences at the same time we want it to be rich in user accesibity features and each letters, words, verse should be interactivable with rich features. Also, apart from GLORIOUS QURAN TEXT that is already avai;able in json we want to have a features rich admin end to manage all Qur'anic Sciences contents which works fully with user's end and also we want them to be exportable to json or other format for others to be able to use them in there Islamic Projects, also we want each sciences to support multiple languages at both user end and admin end contents managments areas mapping to each letter, word, verse(s) as appropriate.  As said the UI/UX should like a Physical Mushaf Qur'an and also feel like a native mobile app. No dummies, Simulation, Prototype, mock or hardcoded datas, all should be accurate and dynamic, fully production ready. For all the content managments, we want to use a seperate standalone github repo as db leveraging on the attached sdk.  NB: There are some things in the sdk you might not need and there are some that are might be buggy or not professional enough, part of your task is to standardized the github sdk, but ensure some previous issues that was later solved in the current sdk such as sha confluct issues which is now using ques, are still effective or even better. Also, for the email that is buitin into the sdk, replace it with a custom nodemailer using gmail app credentials, also use the sdk's builtin auth, not next-auth orr other auth. Also, common issue with the sdk is that, on most occassion the github db repo are always empty for the first time, if the the sdk tries to write or get datas from the repo, it result in error, the expected approach is that there should be a collection/schema's evolution runner that always check and update the repos collection and schema if not available or there is a schema's or collection changes. I have attached the github db sdk. Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Roheem. Alhamdulillah. Audit the current codebase smartly and make a productontodo.md with tasks, sub tasks, sub sub tasks needed to be done to make the platform fully fledged, features rich and fully production ready.
