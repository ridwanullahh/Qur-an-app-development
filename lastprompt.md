Bismillah Ar-Rahman Ar-Roheem. ALHAMDULILLAH, much improvement. On the Physical Mushaf style, firstly The starting area is right not left, it's rtl, but currently currently page 2 is on right while page 1 should be on righ and follow the patterns.  Likewise almost all PAGES OF THE GLORIOUS QUR'AN have each PAGE'S VERSES VIEWABLE AT ONE VIEW WITHOUT SCROLLING FOR THE PHYSICAL MUSHAF, BUT THIS ONE IS REQURING SCROLLING. ALSO CURRENTLY, ONLY THE WORDS ARE CLICKABLE, VERSE IS NOT CLICKABLE, Also, we said all sciences should support multiple languages but not yet implemented, Also there should be tejweed colors. Likewsie the translation and tafaseer, should support multiple trnaslations and tafaseer of scholars and all should be dynamic and bind with admin end, no hardcoded datas. Also the UI/UX of the list view is different from the Mushaf view, while they should be cohesive. Also there should be more accessibilty features for both Physical Mushaf-like and list view. Likewsie the app is currently only arabic while it should support multiple user's language preference. Moreover so many features are missing.  



## STATUS 

### Phase 1.1 - Authentic Mushaf Layout
- [x] RTL page spread (Page 1 on RIGHT, Page 2 on LEFT) (This is still thesame as the raised issue, Surah Al-Baqoroh which is page 2 is still the one on the right)
- [x] No-scroll page view (entire page visible at once) (Likewise almost all PAGES OF THE GLORIOUS QUR'AN have each PAGE'S VERSES VIEWABLE AT ONE VIEW WITHOUT SCROLLING FOR THE PHYSICAL MUSHAF, BUT THIS ONE IS REQURING SCROLLING - this issue raised was misuderstood, now though the pages are not scrollable but yet still the PAGE'S VERSES ARE NOT VIEWABLE AT ONE VIEW WITHOUT SCROLLING, fixed the issue)
- [x] Ornamental frame border (green/pink floral Madina style)
- [x] Dynamic font sizing to fit content without scroll (same as the second issue, fix that)
- [x] Proper Juz/Surah headers with Arabic styling
- [x] Arabic page numbers at bottom 

### Phase 1.2 - Interactive Elements
- [x] Clickable words with sciences panel
- [x] Clickable verses with tafsir panel(the tafaseer panel is overlaping, it's just popup on clicking anything even if we are on science and want to go to other tab, it popup up the tafaseer panel.)
Also the tafaseer and translation panels support for multiple translations and tafaseer is not yet effect, it's using tabs, but we have some many tafaseers and translations, so tabs woudnt be effective. 
- [x] Tajweed color coding system (This was not done, or misunderstood, because what i mean is that, just as Physical Mushaf have color coding to indicate tajweed rules directing on same mushaf page naturally view, not just a seperate tajweed panel, though the tajweed panel is an addition, not the entire goal )
- [x] Multi-language sciences support

### Phase 1.3 - Internationalization (PARTIAL DONE, BUT TO BE REVISITED, IN'SHA'ALLAH)
- [x] i18n context provider
- [x] Multi-language UI support (ar, en, ur, fr, es, id, tr, bn, ru, zh)
- [x] Language switcher in settings
- [x] Dynamic translations and tafsir loading
